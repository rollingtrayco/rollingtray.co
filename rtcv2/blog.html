            <h3>Our Vision for the Future</h3>
            <p>Here at The Rolling Tray Co, the workshop is never quiet. We're driven by a passion for the craft and are constantly exploring new ways to elevate the tools of your ritual. We're excited to give you a glimpse into what's on the horizon.</p>
            <h4>Expanding the Wood Selection</h4>
            <p>While we love our core selection of Ash, Walnut, and Sapele, we're currently sourcing and testing a range of exotic and unique hardwoods. Imagine the deep, inky blacks of Wenge or the striking stripes of Zebrano. Our goal is to offer a palette of materials that allows you to find a tray that truly matches your personal style.</p>
            <h4>New Designs & Accessories</h4>
            <p>The classic tray design is our foundation, but we're refining new layouts and companion pieces. Get ready for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clipper Lighter Stands:</strong> Beautifully crafted stands to display your collection.</li>
                <li><strong>Matching Ashtrays:</strong> Elegant, minimalist ashtrays designed to complement your tray.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Level Trays:</strong> For the connoisseur who needs more space and organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Bespoke Studio: Your Vision, Our Hands</h4>
            <p>This is our most ambitious project yet. We will be launching a custom order service where you become the designer. Through an interactive tool on our website, you will be able to design your own tray layout, choose your wood, and even add custom engravings. It's the ultimate expression of personal style, and we cannot wait to bring your vision to life.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned to The Journal for official launch dates and sneak peeks. The best is yet to come.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Your Tray in Prime Condition</h3>
            <p>A hardwood rolling tray is an investment in your ritual. With a few simple steps, you can ensure it remains a beautiful and functional centerpiece for years, even decades, to come. Wood is a natural material, and a little care goes a long way.</p>
            <h4>Regular Cleaning</h4>
            <p>After each session, simply use a soft, dry cloth or a soft-bristled brush (like a clean paintbrush) to wipe away any loose material. For more stubborn residue, a slightly damp cloth is all you need. <strong>Never</strong> submerge your tray in water or use harsh chemical cleaners, as this will damage the wood and the finish.</p>
            <h4>Conditioning the Wood (The Most Important Step)</h4>
            <p>Every month or two, or whenever the wood starts to look a little dry or dull, it's time to re-condition it. This nourishes the wood and protects it from drying out.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Apply a small amount of food-safe mineral oil or a specialized wood butter/wax to a clean, soft cloth.</li>
                <li>Gently rub the conditioner into the wood, following the direction of the grain. Make sure to cover the entire surface, including the cutouts and edges.</li>
                <li>Let it sit and soak in for at least 20-30 minutes (or even overnight).</li>
                <li>With another clean cloth, buff off any excess. The wood will have a renewed, satin sheen.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>What to Avoid</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Sunlight:</strong> Prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade the wood's natural colour.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme Temperatures:</strong> Avoid leaving your tray near a radiator or in a cold car, as drastic temperature changes can cause the wood to warp or crack.</li>
                <li><strong>Dishwashers:</strong> Absolutely never put your tray in a dishwasher.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's it! With minimal effort, your tray will not only perform flawlessly but will also develop a richer character and patina over time.</p>
